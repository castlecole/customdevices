# SmartThings Unofficial Documentation

Many of the endpoints (and parameters for them) documented below were discovered via trial and error methods. However, a more complete list of endpoints can be found in this [Titanium project here.](https://github.com/alanleard/ti.smart/blob/master/src/lib/smart.js) However, it should be noted that not all of those seem to work. The endpoints documented here have been tested. No promises things won't change and it should be expected that they will.

## Projects
Projects allow you to setup a community around what you're building for SmartThings. You are given the ability to setup blogs, galleries, and more.

You first need an account on [http://build.smartthings.com](http://build.smartthings.com) which is different than your account for using your device (which is used with http://graph.api.smarthings.com). Then you can go to create a project at the following URL: [http://build.smartthings.com/projects/create/](http://build.smartthings.com/projects/create/)

## SmartApps
SmartApps are the actual applications/widgets which users can install to the SmartThings mobile application. They use OAuth to authenticate and allow access to the API. This allows an end-user to individually disable/control access for any SmartApp. If you're familiar with Facebook apps - this is very similar.

You can create smart apps here: [https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/apps](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/apps)

*Note: You may not have access to this section if you are not registered as a developer.*

## JSON API Endpoints
First off, you need to be logged into http://graph.api.smarthings.com … Which is simple enough. You can then go on to see a list of your hubs and events, among other things, in their dashboard. However, we're after JSON responses and all of hte data you see here is available in (seemingly open) JSON responses.

For the purposes of the following example responses, note that  `<idHashString>` values represent 32 character long alpha-numeric unique IDs. You will see other placeholder values as well, but the `<idHashString>` values will be useful to make other API calls. You will see another hash string placeholder value `<uuid>` which is a normal [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). All other placeholder values are simply strings if not clearly specified.

### Authenticating
Before you can make any of these HTTP requests you will need to be logged in. You can do that manually as explained above, but you can also with code using OAuth via one of your SmartApps. For additional information, see the official (under construction) documentation: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14F5CnjIbI8Ru4-MrjHXhnBGGQngUevVEe7H3cqoGHKA/edit?pli=1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14F5CnjIbI8Ru4-MrjHXhnBGGQngUevVEe7H3cqoGHKA/edit?pli=1)

Remember, every call that you will be making will display data relative to the account you are authenticated with. You will not have permission to view certain data and you certainly can't get information about other accounts.

### Accounts
Get information about the accounts for the currently authenticated user.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts)

Example response:

	[
		{
			id: "<idHashString>",
			name: "<email>'s Account",
			fullName: "<yourName>",
			locked: false,
			permissions: "a"
		}
	]

### Account Details
You'll want to replace "idHashString" here in the URL with your account ID string found in the **Accounts** endpoint or **Locations** endpoint. This call will return a combination of some of the data found in some of the other endpoints. It will include your account, locations, and recent events.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString)

### Account Locations
Get information about locations for a specific account. Replace "idHashString" with your account ID string found in the **Accounts** endpoint or **Locations** endpoint.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString/locations](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString/locations)

### Account Events
Get the recent events for an account. Replace "idHashString" with your account ID string found in the **Accounts** endpoint or **Locations** endpoint.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString/events](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString/events)

**Params**    
`all=<boolean>`    
`max=<number>`    
`source=<boolean>`

The default is to display the ten most recent displayed events. Changing this will number will return more or less events. For example: https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/accounts/idHashString/events?max=20

If `all` is true, then all events will be returned. If `source` is true, then only events not displayed back to the user will be returned. This would include some more detailed information from the sensors including if they are battery powered or not, etc.

Example response:

	[
		{
			id: "<uuid>",
			hubId: "<idHashString>",
			description: "SmartSense Motion detected motion has stopped",

	}

### Device Events
Get the recent events for a given device (given its deviceId).

*Note: The JSON response looks just like the "events" section from the device details endpoint and currently includes the last 10 events.*    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devices/idHashString/events](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devices/idHashString/events)

**Params**    
`all=<boolean>`    
`max=<number>`    
`source=<boolean>`

### Device Roles
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devices/idHashString/roles](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devices/idHashString/roles)

### Device Types
Get information about the types of installed devices. This does **not** include any events or readings from the devices. This information is used to populate the SmartThings app dashboard. For example, you will see color hex values for different temperatures which would indicate which color to show based on the current temperature.  If you were to be building your own app, you may find this information useful. It can tell you a lot about each device type. There is a good bit of information in this response.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devicetypes](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/devicetypes)

### All Locations
Get information about locations for all accounts.    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/locations](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/locations)

Example response:

	[
		{
			id: "<idHashString>",
			name: "<yourLocationName>",
			accountId: "<idHashString>",
			latitude: "",
			longitude: "",
			regionRadius: 50,
			backgroundImage: "https://smartthings-location-images.s3.amazonaws.com/standard/standard51.jpg",
			mode: {
				id: "<idHashString>",
				name: "Home"
			},
			modes: [
				{
					id: "<idHashString>",
					name: "Away"
				},
				{
					id: "<idHashString>",
					name: "Home"
				},
				{
					id: "<idHashString>",
					name: "Night"
				}
			],
			permissions: "a"
		}
	]
	
### List All SmartApps
Note: This endpoint will take a little while to load because the response is quite large. It has nothing to do with your hub or account. What it does is it lists all of the available SmartApps that have been created.

It tells you things like the current version of the SmartApp, it's install count, etc. It is essentially an app catalog and it's interesting to browse through it since it contains titles and descriptions for each app. Interestingly enough some of these applications don't even have anything to do with your sensors - though they appear to notify you just the same.

*Note: This call does not require authentication.*    
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/)

### SmartApp Details
This will return information about a particular SmartApp, using its ID which can be found from the above call (or the next call).

*Note: This call does not require authentication.*      
[https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/idHashString](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/idHashString)

### SmartApp Installations
On the otherhand, this endpoint will tell you about the applications a user has installed. This call will return some of the same information found in the above SmartApps details call but also contains some information specific to your account. It will include information such as `eventSubscriptions`, location information, and other preferences specifically set by you when a user installed/configured the SmartApp.
