## Features

The First Alert ZCOMBO is a z-wave protocol smoke and carbon monoxide combination alarm. This battery operated alarm will operate with 3rd party, certified z-wave Devices enabled with the First Alert protocol and the basic Command class required by all z-wave Devices. By the requirements of the device class Spec, this Command class does not have to be mapped to any particular functionality for this device. The alarm supports one association group with up to 1 node, and sends its alarms to that group. Note: this alarm is not compatible with Onelink.

*3-volt battery-operated carbon monoxide and smoke detector provides maximum protection against smoke, fires and poisonous gas.
*Photoelectric smoke sensor reduces false alarms from cooking, candles or showers and detects slow, smoky and smoldering fires for added safety.
*Peak level history shows previous levels of carbon monoxide to help emergency responders determine the best method of treatment.
*Test/silence button ensures your detector is up and running and easily mutes any nuisance alarms that may occur for added convenience.
*Low battery warning alerts you when it’s time to replace them (2 AA batteries included).
*Mounting screws included for easy installation in bedrooms, kitchens, hallways or basements.
*Integrated wireless alarm system is Iris compatible to send you mobile alerts and emails, so you’re aware of dangers after the alarm is activated, whether you’re home or away.
