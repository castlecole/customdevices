### Photoelectric Sensor Warns of Smoldering Fires
The First Alert ZSMOKE alarm comes equipped with a photoelectric sensor to provide the earliest possible warning of fire. The sensor is optimized to detect larger smoke particles produced by smoldering fires, such as those caused by unextinguished cigarettes. It also distinguishes between real threats and smoke and vapor produced during showering, cooking, and other everyday activities, helping minimize the number of false alarms. A patented smoke entry system helps ensure reliable detection by providing a direct air pathway to the sensor.

### Dual Sensors Guard Against Danger
The First Alert ZCOMBO alarm features a photoelectric sensor that detects the smoke most commonly produced by smoldering fires, providing sensitive detection while minimizing false alarms from cooking or shower steam. The advanced electrochemical CO sensor detects carbon monoxide leaks from multiple sources such as, faulty fuel-burning appliances. Unique alarm sounds and indicator lights on the face of the detector distinguish a smoke warning from a carbon monoxide warning.

### Battery-Operated for Convenience
The battery-operated dual CO smoke alarm installs in minutes, without requiring an electrician. The unit requires two AA batteries, and features a chirp and indicator light to let you know when they need replacing. The alarm mounts easily to a ceiling or wall, and comes with pins to secure alarm to the base to prevent tampering.

### Mobile Alerts for Peace of Mind
The integrated wireless alarm system is Iris compatible to send you mobile alerts and emails, so you-re aware of dangers after the alarm is activated, whether your’e home or away. The alarm is also compatible with 3rd party, certified z-wave devices with the First Alert protocol.
