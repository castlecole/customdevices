                       ZSMOKE - Smoke Alarm                          ZCOMBO - Smoke & CO Alarm

## Features

The First Alert ZCOMBO is a z-wave protocol smoke and carbon monoxide combination alarm. This battery operated alarm will operate with 3rd party, certified z-wave Devices enabled with the First Alert protocol and the basic Command class required by all z-wave Devices. By the requirements of the device class Spec, this Command class does not have to be mapped to any particular functionality for this device. The alarm supports one association group with up to 1 node, and sends its alarms to that group. Note: this alarm is not compatible with Onelink.

### Dual Sensors Guard Against Danger
The First Alert ZCOMBO alarm features a photoelectric sensor that detects the smoke most commonly produced by smoldering fires, providing sensitive detection while minimizing false alarms from cooking or shower steam. The advanced electrochemical CO sensor detects carbon monoxide leaks from multiple sources such as, faulty fuel-burning appliances. Unique alarm sounds and indicator lights on the face of the detector distinguish a smoke warning from a carbon monoxide warning.

### Battery-Operated for Convenience
The battery-operated dual CO smoke alarm installs in minutes, without requiring an electrician. The unit requires two AA batteries, and features a chirp and indicator light to let you know when they need replacing. The alarm mounts easily to a ceiling or wall, and comes with pins to secure alarm to the base to prevent tampering.

### Mobile Alerts for Peace of Mind
The integrated wireless alarm system is Iris compatible to send you mobile alerts and emails, so you-re aware of dangers after the alarm is activated, whether your’e home or away. The alarm is also compatible with 3rd party, certified z-wave devices with the First Alert protocol.
